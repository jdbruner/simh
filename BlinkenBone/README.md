# BlinkenBone - extend the SimH simulator with real or simulated console panels.

"BlinkenBone" is an architecture to connect simulators of vintage computers
with "Blinkenlight panels".

The panels can be vintage physical panels enhanced with modern micro-Linux controllers,
or graphical Java simulations of the panels.

The interface between simulator and panel is a network-base client/server model.

At the moment, DEC PDP-11/20, PDP-11/40, PDP-11/70, PDP-8/I, PDP-10/KI10
and PDP-15 are available.

Sources and precompiled distributions for Win32, Ubuntu and RaspberryPi can be downloaded.
This version has been derived from the original (https://github.com/j-hoppe/BlinkenBone),
and integrated into the simh source tree. The build process has been tailored to building
on the current platform. For cross-platform builds, consult the original source.
